//! Utilities to create and test hardware agnostic flight systems with little friction
//!
//! This preflight crate goes hand and hand with the [`cargo_preflight`] cargo
//! subcommand. Alone, this crate will produce a stable, plugable interface for
//! a flight computer to link to. When paired with the [`cargo_preflight`] command,
//! users are able to run the flight systems through rigorous simulations and
//! tests to verify their integrity.
